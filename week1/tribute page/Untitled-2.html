<h1>Python Introduction</h1>
<p>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
    Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</p>
    <p>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
        Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
        Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h1>
        <p><ol>
            <li>
                Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p\>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

        <h1>What is Python? Executive Summary
        </h1>
<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
